## TODO

### Bugs
- Check the filter that excludes tests in progress PRs. It does not seem to work (review app issues?).

### Improvements
- Shell autocompletion.
- Add Homebrew formula.
- URLs to PRs can be displayed with shorter text in terminal (cmd+click still works), example in tty-link. It can save some space in console, but not all terminals support it.
